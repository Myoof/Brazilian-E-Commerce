# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Engineering Take-Home
This project implements an end-to-end data pipeline using Mage AI and PostgreSQL to enable business intelligence from raw e-commerce transaction data. The pipeline automates ETL processes for customer segmentation, revenue trend analysis, and product popularity insights.

## Overview and Insights:

**Tech used:** Magi AI, Python (Pandas, sqlalchemy), SQL (PostgreSQL)

The objective of this project was to familiarize myself with Mage AI and fundamental data engineering practices. I used a publically available dataset for Brazilian E-Commerce (link below) which consisted of nine files recording the data for things like orders, customers, purchase metadata, and even geolocation. Using Mage AI, I was able to extract the data from my local machine, perform basic operations to find useful metrics like customer segmentation and product popularity insights, and finally export that data back into PostgreSQL databases I had initialized earlier. My main approach was to take the project step by step, learning how to use the Mage AI UI and how to create an efficient pipeline. I went through several iterations of minimizing the amount of blocks I used to increasing modularization until I found a way to organize my pipeline in an intuitive and efficient manner.

It was an incredible experience working mainly within the Mage AI user interface which allowed me to do everything from creating visual block-based coding for managing modularization to scheduling my pipeline to run automatically. In the end, I created a full end-to-end ETL pipeline from scratch using nothing but Mage AI and the raw dataset from kaggle.com.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
